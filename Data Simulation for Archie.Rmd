# Order Execution Rate Sampling Frequency

Orders are executed based on when they come in, the complexity of the order, the
system resources, and likely other factors as well. They vary somewhat in time
to fully complete and begin at semi-random times, but we are more interested in
the rate at which they are executed (finished).

## Initial Data Thoughts

Based on what I've learned from Archie, there are two time series to create, and
then combine: time and orders executed.

### Time

The measurement of orders executed will happen stochastically, but certain
aspects of the distribution of the timing are known.

* Mean time between measurements:    750ms
* Minimum time between measurements: 10ms
* Maximum time between measurements: 2s

I will convert this to a Weibull distribution, with estimated parameters
chosen to attempt to have the 95th percentile be near 2, and the 1st percentile
near 0.01 (10ms). I am choosing to use a shifted Weibull (location isn't 0), and
actually allow negative values. I will replace all values less than 0.01 with
0.01, to simulate a forced measurement minimum of 10ms.

```{r TimeVectorCreation, fig.align = "center", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 10}

t <- rweibull(24*60*60, shape = 1.97, scale = 0.96) - 0.1 # location = -0.1
t[t <= 0.01] <- 0.01

t2 <- vector(mode = 'numeric', length = length(t) + 1)
for (i in 2:length(t2)) {
  t2[i] <- t2[i-1] + t[i-1]
}

# The range of possible values for the time between measurements
range(t)

# Statistics of t
describe(t)

# The distribution of t
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
plot(density(t),
     main = "Probability Density of Time Distribution",
     xlab = "Time Between Measurments in Seconds",
     ylab = "Probability"
     )
hist(t, 
     breaks = 100,
     main = "Histogram of Time Distribution Differences",
     xlab = "Time Between Measuements in Seconds",
     ylab = "Count"
     )
```

### Orders Executed

A seemingly random number of orders will be executed within each time period. In
reality, this number would be somewhat dependent on the time interval, with
larger numbers of orders executed with larger time intervals, and smaller 
numbers of orders executed with smaller intervals.

I may attempt to create a correlation between length of time interval and the
number of orders executed, but we'll see.

The number of orders executed will happen stochastically, but certain
aspects of the distribution of the number executed are known.

* Mean number of orders executed between measurements:    1200
* Minimum number of orders executed between measurements: 0
* Maximum number of orders executed between measurements: 2000

I will convert this to a Weibull distribution, with estimated parameters
chosen to attempt to have the 99th percentile be near 2000, and the 
1st percentile near 0. I am choosing to use a shifted Weibull 
(location isn't 0), and actually allow negative values. I will replace all 
values less than 0 with 0, to simulate a slight bump in number of instances at 
0. I will also take the floor of every value, because the number of orders
executed cannot be a non-integer.

```{r OrderVectorCreation, fig.align = "center", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 10}

o <- rweibull(24*60*60+1, shape = 7.483, scale = 3036) - 1650 # location = -1650
o[o <= 0] <- 0
o <- floor(o)

# The range of possible values for the number of orders executed each period
range(o)

# Statistics of o
describe(o)

# The distribution of o
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
plot(density(o),
     main = "Probability Density of Orders Executed Distribution",
     xlab = "Orders Executed Each Period",
     ylab = "Probability"
     )
hist(o, 
     breaks = 100,
     main = "Histogram of Orders Executed Distribution",
     xlab = "Orders Executed Each Period",
     ylab = "Count"
     )
```

Now I will create the final raw dataset for analysis in Tableau.

```{r TableauRawPrep}

tableau <- as.data.frame(cbind(t2, o))
colnames(tableau) <- c("time", "orders executed")
write.csv(tableau, "Archie_Tableau_Data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

In addition, I will create a set of data that represents the moving average of
orders executed per second, based on measurements windows ranging from 50ms to
5s in 50ms increments. So each measurement window will have a corresponding set
of average orders executed per second.

```{r WindowPresets}

# I take the sum of orders executed less than the current time, and subtract
# the sum for the previous time value, determining the number of orders executed
# in that time interval.

create_meas <- function(f_meas) {
  current_meas <- f_meas
  time_intervals <- seq(0, ceiling(max(t2)), f_meas)
  temp_meas <- time_intervals
  temp_orders <- time_intervals
  temp_meas[1] <- sum(tableau$`orders executed`[tableau$time < current_meas])
  temp_orders[1] <- sum(tableau$`orders executed`[tableau$time < current_meas])
  for (i in 2:length(temp_meas)) {
    temp_meas[i] <- sum(tableau$`orders executed`[tableau$time < current_meas])
    temp_orders[i] <- temp_meas[i] - temp_meas[i-1]
    current_meas <- current_meas + f_meas
  }
  temp_orders <- temp_orders / f_meas
  measurement_interval <- rep(f_meas, length(temp_orders))
  cumave <- cumsum(temp_orders) / seq_along(temp_orders)
  temp_meas_out <- as.data.frame(cbind(measurement_interval,
                                       time_intervals,
                                       temp_orders,
                                       cumave))
  temp_meas_out
}

measure_list <- seq(0.250, 5.000, 0.250)

ptm <- proc.time()
averages <- create_meas(measure_list[1])
elapsed_time_temp <- proc.time() - ptm
elapsed_time <- elapsed_time_temp[3]
message <- paste(measure_list[1], 
                 "s interval completed in ",
                 format(elapsed_time_temp[3]),
                 "s. Total elapsed time: ",
                 format(elapsed_time), "s.")
print(message)

for (i in 2:length(measure_list)) {
  ptm <- proc.time()
  meas_x <- create_meas(measure_list[i])
  averages <- rbind(averages, meas_x)
  elapsed_time_temp <- proc.time() - ptm
  elapsed_time <- elapsed_time + elapsed_time_temp[3]
  message <- paste(measure_list[i], 
                   "s interval completed in ",
                   format(elapsed_time_temp[3]),
                   "s. Total elapsed time: ",
                   format(elapsed_time), "s.")
  print(message)
}

colnames(averages) <- c("measurement interval",
                        "time",
                        "orders executed per second",
                        "cumulative average")
write.csv(averages, "Archie_Tableau_Data_Average_Rates.csv")
```
